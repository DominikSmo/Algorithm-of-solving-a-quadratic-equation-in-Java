<h1><bold> A simple program with an algorithm of solving quadratic equations in Java
<h3>In this program user can choose a value for three coefficients of a quadratic equation(a, b and c). Depending on these values a discriminant is greater than zero, equals zero or less than zero.
Then depending on a value of delta(discriminant) of a quadratic equation a program based on input numeric values of coefficients of an equation computes the root(s) of an equation or provides information about 
lack of solution.
